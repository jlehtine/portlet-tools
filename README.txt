PORTLET TOOLS FOR MAVEN
=======================

NOTE: This is an ARCHIVED project. Development of portlets having any real
functionality typically requires many services (e.g. database, user
management) not provided by the portlet prototyping plugin contained here.

Having said that, please feel free to use the tools and the codebase if you
find them useful. Current master branch should compile with OpenJDK 8.


Tools for developing Java portlets in Maven based projects. This project
contains submodules that are intended to be used for rapid portlet
development in Maven based portlet development projects.

This project uses the Jetty servlet container and the Apache Pluto portlet
container as basis for a light weight portlet prototyping environment.

For more information on Jetty and Apache Pluto, see:
